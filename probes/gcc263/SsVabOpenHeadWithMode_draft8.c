 * LIBSND VS_VH member: SsVabOpenHeadWithMode (g3org_jp 0x48864, extent
 * 0x448). DRAFT 4 (cron-202611032028): draft3 with vabid/mode and the two
 * signature params widened short->long - full-word pins. DIFF 219/228
 * SIZE 912: the best WithMode judge number so far; see draft3's RESULT
 * block for the ladder and the consequence.
 *
 * Experiment: the param imports re-authored as pinned-local inits -
 * the 7736C interleave bypass (NEGATIVE on every form; the full ladder
 * and its consequence live in draft3's RESULT block below).
 *
 * DRAFT 6 (cron-202611032143): this file carries `cc-post: rule15` -
 * the first live run of cc_post rule 15 prologue-param-interleave,
 * built from the negative result above: gcc keeps the batch prologue,
 * so the retail interleave is reproduced as a post-pass reorder
 * (pairs in import order, ra last, leftover saves after, the last
 * leftover save in the first call's delay slot).
 *
 * RESULT (POSITIVE - the whole prologue closes): judge DIFF 206/228
 * SIZE 912 (draft4-no-rule15 was 219/228; one iteration caught a
 * duplicate-save bug: rest[-1] was emitted both before AND after the
 * jal - the delay fill must consume it). Byte-exact 0x80068064 through
 * 0x800680A0: frame, all five pairs (s3/s0/s2/s6/s5), sw ra LAST,
 * sw s4, jal _spu_getInTransfer, sw s1 IN THE JAL DELAY, and the ori
 * v1,1 verdict constant. FIRST REMAINING DIFF = 0x800680A4: the
 * polarity-inverted verdict (built beq-to-return + addiu -1 delay vs
 * retail bne-to-continue + addu s1,s0 COPY delay) - the known body
 * wave (banked cron-202611030614), then the 139-word structural
 * middle. Loud-fail verified: --rule15 on a non-matching run exits 3.
 *
 * DRAFT 8 (cron-202611040358): this file adds `cc-post: rule16` -
 * the first live run of cc_post rule 16 verdict-polarity, built from
 * the polarity lever being measured NOT source-shape reachable
 * (draft7/7b, cron-202611040243). The transform (pure post-pass
 * invert+reorder, no dataflow scan needed): beq $2,$3,$Ltail with the
 * addiu $2,$zero,-1 branch delay rewrites as bne $2,$3,$Lr16c (+3 ==
 * retail's exact offset) with the SAME li kept as the bne delay
 * (unconditional both paths - semantics identical to built), then
 * j $Ltail + li as the j delay (retail's fail materialize), then the
 * continue body unchanged under $Lr16c:.
 *
 * RESULT (POSITIVE on the lever, NEUTRAL on the raw count): judge
 * DIFF 208/230 SIZE 920 (from 206/228; matched words stay 22). FIRST
 * DIFF ADVANCES 0x800680A4 -> 0x800680A8: the verdict branch word is
 * BYTE-EXACT (built bne $2,$3,+3 == retail 0x14430003) - the polarity
 * lever is CLOSED as a post-pass. The +2 raw = (a) 0x800680AC the j
 * word: built tail $L44 sits at 0x800683D0, retail's at 0x80068480 -
 * 0xB0 apart, the 139-word structural middle's size delta; the j word
 * cannot match until the middle closes; (b) the inserted pair shifts
 * difflib's alignment by 2 through the skew-dominated slt/bnez region.
 * NEXT: (1) the copy-in-delay composition - draft7b put addu s1,s0 in
 * the branch delay with right adjacency but kept beq; a rule16 variant
 * accepting a copy delay (value for the inserted j-delay li taken as a
 * marker arg, remnant-ori1 precedent) would make 0x800680A8 exact too
 * and leave ONLY the j word in the verdict window; (2) the 139-word
 * structural middle (0x80068160..0x80068388); (3) then the j word and
 * the region twins come free.
 * Loud-fail verified: --rule16 on a non-matching unit exits 3.
 *
 * Retail prologue being chased (asm/g3org_jp/nonmatchings/func_80068064.s):
 *   addiu sp,-0x438 / sw s3,0x424 / addu s3,a0 (vh->s3 $19)
 *   sw s0,0x418 / addu s0,a1 (vabid->s0 $16)
 *   sw s2,0x420 / ori s2,0x10 (slot=0x10 init ->s2 $18)
 *   sw s6,0x430 / addu s6,a3 (addr->s6 $22)
 *   sw s5,0x42C / addu s5,a2 (mode->s5 $21) / sw ra LAST (+ s1 save in
 *   the getInTransfer jal delay; s1 = the vabid copy - body wave, not
 *   attempted here).
 *
 * METRIC: prologue words go interleaved? Everything else is draft2
 * verbatim (wave-1 scan/program-loop laws + wave-2 no-shared-err-free
 * law carried; the 139-word structural middle stays open either way).
