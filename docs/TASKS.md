# TASKS

Queued work for this repository, newest on top, with a record of what was done
below. Queued tasks are written for whoever picks them up next — usually the
sandbox agent, which is where the build toolchain lives.

## Queued

### Carve the code out of the `data` rows — the other direction

The landed carve-pin patch handles `asm` rows whose bytes are data. The mirror
error is larger: rows the splat map calls `data` that are really code, and it
is measured, not suspected.

* 12.9% of every byte the eight maps label `data` is byte-verified Psy-Q
  library code — 446 KB of 3.45 MB — measured with `tools/libshare.py` at
  3.3. 77% of the whole library share sits in `data` rows.
* Runtime agrees: `tools/coverage_vs_fragments.py` reports regions the static
  classifier calls `ORPHAN … end=data_stop` that the CPU executes — 13 in
  slps_00270, 4 in g3org_jp, 1 in mainmenu_jp.

A walk-stop rule symmetric to the pin — a `data` row whose bytes are a
byte-verified SDK member, or carry a high instruction-validity density — would
surface them. The SDK re-pin is DONE (see Log): the 3.3 match set below is
this task's evidence base.

### Re-pin the Psy-Q SDK to 3.3 and regenerate the SDK reports

DONE 2026-10-12 — see Log. The reports now pin 3.3 (144 anchored placements,
897 sig agreements); docs/MATCHING.md §3b/§3c updated.

## Log

**2026-10-12 — the SDK re-pin landed (3.3).**
- `config/sdk_members.txt` regenerated against `~/psyq/3.3/PSX/LIB` with
  `--sigs psx_psyq_signatures/330`: 968 placements (was 781), **144 anchored
  (was 8 — one per target; now 16-23 each)**, 13 adoptable names (was 11),
  897 signature-DB agreements. `config/sdk_symbols.txt` is UNCHANGED: the
  same 5 veneer sites resolve at 3.3 and 4.0.
- The 117 `sig-db elsewhere` rows concentrate exactly where §3c says sibling
  families live: 60 LIBSND + 57 LIBCD. One `no-hit`.
- docs/MATCHING.md §3b/§3c updated to the 3.3 path and the measured
  agree/elsewhere census. The code-in-data carve below can now use the 3.3
  match set as its evidence base.

**2026-10-12 — the Psy-Q library share, calibrated.**
- `tools/libshare.py` — matches each SDK member's *individual* functions (split
  at its own `.text` symbols) against the payload, not whole members. Over the
  eight targets at 3.3: **13.2% of payload bytes** are Psy-Q library code, and
  about the same share of the scanner's function list (1509/11463). The boot
  executables are library-heavy (slps 24%, sces 17%); the game executables run
  9–15%.
- `tools/sdk_members.py` under-counts badly: it needs an entire member present,
  and these binaries linked the library function-granular. On slps_00270 the
  whole-member scan covers 1.8% of the payload against 23.7% here. The
  function-level set recovers 97% of the committed report's 810 placement rows,
  83% of its 128 confident rows, and finds ~5× more.
- The pinned SDK is the wrong release: the same scan finds 1.8% of the payload
  at 4.0 and 13.2% at 3.3 (see Queued).
- Library code sits inside ranges the splat map calls `data` — an evenly
  0x30-spaced libetc callback block (`ResetCallback`, `DMACallback`,
  `VSyncCallback`, `GetIntrMask`) lies inside `data_8002FD9C` in slps_00270.
  That carve error runs the other way from the 37 ranges
  `tools/code_data_screen.py` flags.

**2026-10-12 — carve-type pins applied (d683dc9).**
- The queued `docs/carve-pin.patch` landed: 37 DATA-verdict rows re-typed to
  `pinned` data across the eight splat maps, `preserved_types()` taught to
  preserve them. The patch file stays for reference.
- Two round-trip gaps in `tools/scan_functions.py` had to close before the
  pins held; both are now regression-tested by the pin's own acceptance check
  (`code_data_screen --all` after every re-scan):
  1. *marker loss* — the generated-block writer never re-emitted the
     `pinned` comment, so the next scan read an unmarked data row and
     re-typed the range back to code. `preserved_types()` now returns the
     pinned set and the writer re-emits the marker; double scans are
     idempotent on all 8 targets.
  2. *pin-span enforcement* — `hard_stops` only blocked seeds AT the pinned
     start; a j-target strictly inside the span seeded a walk that swallowed
     the pin (witnessed: g3_eu `func_80022A1C` out of pinned
     `data_80022A18`). Pins are now no-walk zones: `walk()` refuses in-pin
     starts and stops before pin words; the v2/v4/v3 seed loops skip pin
     interiors.
- The no-walk rule exposed a third gap: kept rows fully inside a data gap
  were swallowed by the gap (mainmenu_jp `data_800253C4`). `main()` carves
  kept gap rows out as their own subsegment pieces now.
- Post-apply: all 8 targets `make verify` exit 0; stale pseudo-function rows
  removed via `clean_stale_asm.py`; re-audit = 0 DATA / 25 SUSPECT (25 is the
  documented human-call set); ratchets 317/12 and matched C count 80
  unchanged.

**2026-10-12 — static carve auditing.**
- `tools/code_data_screen.py` — flags code subsegments whose bytes are data. 37
  across the eight targets; calibrated against the known `0x80021800` =
  `CD_cachefile`.
- `tools/crossbuild_align.py` — aligns a JP/EU pair by unique-k-mer anchors plus
  LIS. Inside aligned regions the two sides are 88–93% byte-identical, against
  16–24% at fixed offset. Reports that ~35–44% of mappable boundaries disagree
  on code-vs-data.
- `tools/struct_infer.py` — clusters memory accesses into field maps with
  signedness (`lb`/`lbu`, `lh`/`lhu`); drops runs of identical non-nop words,
  which are data misdecoded as code.
- `tools/crossbuild_diff.py` — kept as a weak reference; its docstring records
  why fixed-offset byte-identity cannot validate boundaries here.
- `docs/TOOLCHAIN.md` — compiler-fingerprint table re-measured; the counts had
  drifted after the stale-asm cleanup.
- `docs/RUNTIME.md` — the PCSX-Redux runtime harness, plus its measured limits:
  exact-address Exec breakpoints fire, range breakpoints and watchpoints do not,
  the exe entry is not caught, and the GDB stub shares the same breakpoint
  store. It is not a carve oracle.
